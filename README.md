# DooGuard

### About this mod

---
This mod allows you to configure the most popular flags of the WorldGuard plugin.  
Now you don't need to worry about command syntax â€” just enter the necessary data, press the required buttons, and get a ready-to-use command.

### Installation

---
Go to the **Releases** menu on the right and download the required version.  
Then, place the downloaded **.jar file** into the `./mods` folder in your Minecraft installation directory.

The mod is designed for **Forge 1.12.2**.

**Important!** The optimal screen resolution for the mod is **1920x1080**.  
Since support for other resolutions is not yet implemented, UI elements may appear misplaced.  
Other resolutions will be supported in future updates.

### Usage

---
By default, the mod opens by pressing the **Right Shift** key in the game,  
but you can change this key in the Minecraft control settings.

When you open the mod window, you will see flag categories at the top.  
Select the desired category, then click on the required flag.  
Enter the region name, flag value, and optionally, the player group the flag applies to.  
If all data is entered correctly, a generated command will appear at the bottom of the screen, where you can copy it.

### Issues

Note that your server may restrict access to certain flags,  
and this mod cannot override such limitations.
